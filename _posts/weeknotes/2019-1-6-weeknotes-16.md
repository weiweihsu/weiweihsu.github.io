Spent the first day of 2019 finishing Kaifu Lee’s “AI Superpower”. It’s been a while since I’ve started and finished a book.

I chose to read the book in Chinese because I’ve realized that it’s hard for me to have a conversation about anything technology related in Chinese, that’s because I learned to talk about design and technology in English.

I’ve learned quite a bit from reading the book, and seeing how he positioned the book in different countries. The book also showed me a way to explain some of the dangers and solutions to those who think technology has near-zero negative impact.
