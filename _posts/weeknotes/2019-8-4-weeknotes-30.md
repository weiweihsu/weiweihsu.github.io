Judgements from people who (indirectly) make me think I'm incapable used to paralyze me. I think I'm getting better at handling judgements from others. Or rather, I now know to step away from them. Maybe.

Several friends have mentioned terrace house to me as I share [Tiny Factories](https://tinyfactories.space) with them. I finally started watching a few episodes of it this week and I get why people love it.

Boba guys has a summer special drink call [heads in the cloud]. I tried it because there's sea salt creama and because it reminded me what my college teacher used to say to me. I'd like to think that I'm less up in the clouds, but I think there's still a lot that I can improve upon.
