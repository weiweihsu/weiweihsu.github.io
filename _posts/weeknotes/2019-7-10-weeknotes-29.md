I remember seeing James Turrell's work for the first time at the De Young Museum freshmen year, and then reading more about it. His work has been brought back several times lattely, and I really want to see or even live in a space that feels so not urban, and nature... Im not sure what I'm getting at here.

I think it's finally sinking into my current lifestyle. Now that I'm independent (for who knows how long), I need to be disciplined and organize my time so that I can get work done, eat healthily, meet up with friends, and more.

I feel that I have endless things to do, so I suppose that will keep me busy for a while. :)

More later.
