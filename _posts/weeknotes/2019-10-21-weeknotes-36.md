Went to my first NBA game (ever) this month! It's a brand new stadium and it was so interesting to see how the stadium was designed, how motion design and sound effects were used during the game, and how different activities were fit into time-out sessions.

Growing up, my mom would put out some halloween decorations in the house, but I've never seen halloween decorations like this!

Walked into a Cabela's (a store that has hunting and camping equipments) for the first time. On one side of the shelve there are unicorn plush toys, on the other shelve there are real guns.
