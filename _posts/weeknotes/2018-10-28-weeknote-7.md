This week went by very fast. I really enjoyed working on shadowing the project at work, learning more about the technical aspect of what we are building, and brainstorming possible interfaces. That was very fun. This process definitely motivated and reminded to learn more coding sooner.

Now that I have this current website running for about a month and half, I've been thinking more about whether I want to show my design projects online. And if I do, which ones would I want to show.

After spending quite a bit of my free time working on portfolio and applying and interviewing, I think I now am actually available to spend my free time on learning new skills.
