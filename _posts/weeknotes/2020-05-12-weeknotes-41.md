And all of a sudden, it's May... A lot has happened in the past few months, in my life, in this world...

What can I say, I really feel like I was in a coma around the end of 2019 (and beginning of 2020). Things were rough for me, and I had a really hard time talking myself out of dark valley I was in. For several weeks, I listened to the song "Don't give up on me" everyday, because I really felt like the world had given up on me.

I'm better now, after asking friends for help, and accepting their help, but it still hurts when I reconnect with the Weiwei from that period.

I'm better now, currently residing in Asia and enjoying the city that I've always wanted to live in.
