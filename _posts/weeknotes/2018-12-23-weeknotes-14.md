This time back, I’ve been ordering customized prints and cards for friend’s companies and myself. That process (not really an experience) is an entirely different one than in America. In America, most people have built a website that covers the entire process so that they don’t have to interface with you. Here in China, you would view their store to get the gist of what you would receive, but the negotiation and file-checking etc are all through a chat. I gotta say, I prefer the latter, even though there are rarely any pretty visual design.

Below is a version of the custom brass stamp I’m ordering. You can switch out the characters because there’s a removable stopper that’s magnetically attached to the stamp.
