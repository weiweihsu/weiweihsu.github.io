Sometimes over dinner, we would watch short (and long) drama. Lately, we made the switch to watching documentaries.

Here are some links to the ones I've enjoyed lately:
<br/>[Knock Down the House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wGZc8ZjFY4)
<br/>[Abstract](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883) (Ruth Carter, and Olafur Eliasson)
<br/>[The Game Changers](https://www.netflix.com/title/81157840)
