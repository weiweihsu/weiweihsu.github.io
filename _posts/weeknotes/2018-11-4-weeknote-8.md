This week, I've finally abandoned Apple Podcasts and switched to Breaker Podcasts. I'v had the Breaker app for a few months now but was never compelled to actually start using it. It wasn't until a podcast I was listening to had half of their season missing on Apple Podcasts, that I decided to switch to Breaker, which had everything. And I will probably never look back. Out of everything, I love the fact that you can adjust playing speed and make it specific to each podcast. It's also helpful to see how many podcasts I've listened to; I've never gotten a sense on how many podcasts I've completed.

When speaking to a consultancy earlier in the week, I've realized what I'm truly interested in: In senior year, I became borderline obssessed with long-term technology research, and spoke with roughly 30 technology researchers. At the same time, I'm always interested in poetic products and putting things in the world. So what does it look like if I merge the two? My current conclusion is that, I want to apply long-term thinking to the creation of poetic and meaningful products.

Probably because of the podcasts I'm listening to, I've been thinking a lot about doing things that don't scale. I fundamentally believe in this when starting out (anything). This has always been how I started different groups at CCA, launched Secret Project Taiwan, and I'm excited for the next series of "doing things that don't scale".

I continue to discover interesting businesses/products/regulations when speaking with friends who are currently living in China. It has also been interesting to see how people to react to these news when sharing them on social media. I wonder if there's a demand for a channel dedicated to this.
