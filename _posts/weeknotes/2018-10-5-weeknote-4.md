This week feels like a week of production work. I spent much less time thinking and a lot more time executing. It feels nice to balance the week with some making, and shipping. It also feels nice to see a project coming together.

In a design school, many students (including me) talk about the want to start our own (design-related) thing. Earlier in the week, I was asked if that desire comes from wanting to extend what I felt and experienced in school, because you then become a small consulting firm. Whereas, if the desire comes from wanting to build a business that can scale, then the work/commitment required is different.
