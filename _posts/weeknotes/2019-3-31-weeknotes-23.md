These past few weeks were packed with things to do and feeling excited and confused. Went to a few events, worked on projects, made some more progress with work.

Started thinking about making small custom fixtures that make home more interesting; including a cluster of pc fans that serve as an air conditioner to cool the space down. Over the next few weeks, I will be prototyping a light bulb holder (a.k.a a lamp) that's made out of cardboard. I think it will be very cool to make a repository of furniture/objects that make a living or working environment more usable and playful.

Attended an event hosted by CCA Architecture Division two weeks ago on co-living. I really appreciated how candid the conversations there were. My main takeaway is: co-living isn't real unless people who share the living spaces are also those who have ownership in the real estate.

This is a Christmas gift I got two years ago and I finally opened it to 'grow' the cactus. It might sound strange to others that I'm only opening a gift two years later, but I have quite a few toys/diy kits that have remained un-opened and I have the tendency to open those only when my mind is fully present for it.

Again and again, I'm amazed by how powerful diagramming and illustrating can be when in a group discussion. They all help increase clarity to the concepts that are being talked among.
