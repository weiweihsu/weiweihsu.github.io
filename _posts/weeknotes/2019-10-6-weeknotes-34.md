Oh wow, I haven't written a weeknote in a month...

The four of us have been building products every week in the last month. It's been really fun and I feel like I'm almost learning as much as I was in college.

I feel that the last time I was this happy is probably the summer of 2018 -- it's been a while. Perhaps this is the process of understanding myself and learning to advocate for myself.

I'm trying to become a little more active on Twitter, treating it as a bookmarking and notetaking place. We will see how it goes.

We were in Tahoe for a few days. I really want to live there at some point.
