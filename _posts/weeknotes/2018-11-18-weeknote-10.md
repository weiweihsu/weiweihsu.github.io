I still need to get better at pitching and proposing. It doesn't feel like I can effectively highlight the key points I want to communicate, perhaps because I'm not experienced enough, or, perhaps I just need to prepr and practice more.

This has been one of the most stressful and relaxing week of the year, but I'm pretty sure there are a few more of these weeks coming before the end of year.

Spending the second half of the week in LA to take a break. I'm really liking this style of working hard and playing hard. It is so refreshing and inspiring to step out of my life, and to breathe and be exposed to other urban areas.

Very grateful for having the opportunity to do take a break like this.

There are so many scooters and bikes in Santa Monica, it is so much fun to inspect all scooter generations on one street. I must say, visual design can really help to differentiate one brand from another. Out of all the scooters I've seen in NorCal and SoCal, I definitely like JUMP and Lyft's scooters the most.

It's also fascinating how everyone I know is now fluent in the scooter language, regardless of whether they love or hate the them. I suppose this is the difference when your products are in real life, versus being digital and not really discoverable unless with intentional marketing. I wonder if meaningful products can be just as discoverable as scooters.

JUMP's branding is pretty slick in my opinion. The way they wrap their logo around the scooter and the bike is great. I also like how their logo on the scooter is retroreflective. It's kind of a bummer to me that they've been acquired by Uber. I really wish that they are an independent startup.
