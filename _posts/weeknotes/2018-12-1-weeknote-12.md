Recently, I've been looking back at the think wrong chart, and thinking about how I'm falling into the trap of going for the safe route. To be honest, ever since graduation, societal pressure around getting a job has been pulling me away from all the ambitions I had when I was in freshman and sophomore year.

I have learned a lot in the past few months, especially around the importance of aligning goals, and how to frame a proposal. I think it is fair to say that I'm now more motivated to work on what I believe in.
