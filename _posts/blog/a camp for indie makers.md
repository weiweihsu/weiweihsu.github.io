### Making a leap of faith
After evaluating and exploring different paths, I think I've settled on something I would like to try.

I will be looking for individuals that are interested in owning their creative freedom. Together, we will experiment with a collaborative incubator model where we will help each other to transition into exploring and launching tools/products full-time.

The idea here is that, starting from this summer, we will all gather in one city, and work inter-dependently to make and launch software, hardware, softgoods, workshops (or pretty much anything that can be "purchased"), every month. With this model, I hope that we will be able to blend the boundaries of making, learning, and researching in order to explore our collective contribution to the world.

### Gain creative autonomy, together
Lately, I've been reading and thinking about the idea of gaining creative autonomy and financial freedom a lot. Most people, including me, have many ideas or (career and lifestyle) paths they would like to explore. However, those paths often require making a large leap that very few end up pursuing what they are truly interested in, early in their life. If making a leap of faith is easier with other people, then why not find a group of people to do it together?

### Practice launching
From producting Secret Project Taiwan, and co-creating my first [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1324099197/quickstarterbbcube-a-shouting-game-for-civilized-p?ref=project_link), I've learned that launching projects is a muscle that you need to exercise, ideally as early and as often.

### Is this meaningful?
A few weeks ago, someone asked me, and I para-phrase:"On your Twitter profile, you said that you are interested in self-actualization, urban systems, and urban systems, how does, say, launching a plugin, align with those goals and interests?" It is a great question.

Though my medium-term goal is to work on energy-first and privacy-first projects, I believe I will be more useful if I can practice making, launching, improving, marketing, selling products in a monthly-cycle, with little risks attached to it. This will not only create opportunities for practicing launching into different markets, but also leave room for products to breathe, and grow organically over time.

### Closing thoughts
To be honest, I'm very nervous about this. However, I feel that this is a now or never thing. While I'm still young, and have little strings attached, I want to do something I'm unlikely to do in 20 years. If this is even mildly successful, I will then focus on more complex projects/products that require dedicated attention.

If you have any thoughts, comments on this, do send me an email or a DM. I would love to hear from people, regardless of if you love it or hate it.
