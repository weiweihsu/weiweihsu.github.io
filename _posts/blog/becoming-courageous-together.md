This post is a post-mortem of a 7-day workshop I ran during the summer of freshman and sophomore year called Secret Project Taiwan. It is also a post about what I would like to work on in the near-future.

One of the most life-changing program I partcipated in during college was called Secret Project at CCA. It was a program directed by John Bielenberg and Marc O'Brien that encouraged everyone to think wrong and to challenge the status quo. Through the Secret Project Blitzes (which were weekend workshops and spring break trips), I realized how powerful it is to dream, and to imagine, together with others.

Secret Project also gave me ideas to run a version of it in Taiwan, where my parents are from. During the summer of 2015 and 2016, I produced and co-facilitated a 7-day workshop, where ~15 college students came together to think of wild ideas, make small bets, and test them out together, on a 500-area large farm south-east of Taipei.

During each Secret Project Taiwan, we would do something called [show me your guts] around bon fire. The idea behind this event is that everyone would have 24 hours to prepare for it, and during [show me your guts], we would either share something they've never said out loud before, or do something they've never done in front of others.

Partially because this, we all become extremely supportive, caring, and bold with what and how we brainstorm, collaborate, and make for the remaining time we had together.

One main feedback we had from participants, was that they all wished Secret Project Taiwan was a year-long gap year program, instead of a week-long "summer camp". During the 7-day workshop, they all got a taste of what it's like to be bold, collaborate, and challenge the status-quo. In essence, the workshop helped everyone to become a little more courageous. However, upon leaving the workshop and returning to each of their own lives, everyone felt that their everyday life was business-as-usual again.

Over the past few years, I have been thinking about what it'd be like to run a longer version of Secret Project Taiwan.

Who is it for?
What would be an ideal outcome?
What would everyone do everyday for a few months?

Having graduated from college a few months ago, I've also been exploring what I want to devote my time to.

What kind of environment do I wish to be in?
What kind of people do I wish to surround myself with?
What should I devote my career to?
How much autonomy do I want in the work I do?
