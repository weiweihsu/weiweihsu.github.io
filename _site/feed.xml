It‚Äôs nice to just relax and read books and play games üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently wrapped up a housing releated project with a few friends. Feels nice to have delivered something different. The exhibition we installed looks like a render because we painted everything in the same color. In retrospect, it doesn‚Äôt feel li kthe presentation was as important, because the event was much more focused on which teams are winnign the award this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/house9.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;housing project's installation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A realization I had recently: I should be working on things that I can personally have the most (positive) impact on, given my set of experiences and skills. There are many topic areas that I‚Äôm personally interested in, but if I don‚Äôt have any leverage over it, or if I don‚Äôt know what I can do tomorrow, it‚Äôs worth it to park the idea for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While commuting, I listened to a podcast where Tim Ferris interviewed Eric Schmidt. Part of the interview was spent discussing about a new book called ‚ÄúA Trillion Dollar Coach‚Äù. I‚Äôve never really thought about the difference between a coach and a mentor in a business context. I really like the idea that as an organization, the goal is to succeed as a team, not to have one person who performs well independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started reading about the difference between doing a listening session vs an interview. Feels like there‚Äôs significant difference between the two, though they may sound similar to most people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Haven‚Äôt had a relatively calming weekend in a few months.

Went to a few events, worked on projects, made some more progress with work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started thinking about making small custom fixtures that make home more interesting; including a cluster of pc fans that serve as an air conditioner to cool the space down. Over the next few weeks, I will be prototyping a light bulb holder (a.k.a a lamp) that‚Äôs made out of cardboard. I think it will be very cool to make a repository of furniture/objects that make a living or working environment more usable and playful.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pcfan.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;pc fan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended an event hosted by CCA Architecture Division two weeks ago on co-living. I really appreciated how candid the conversations there were. My main takeaway is: co-living isn‚Äôt real unless people who share the living spaces are also those who have ownership in the real estate.

&lt;p&gt;This is a Christmas gift I got two years ago and I finally opened it to ‚Äògrow‚Äô the cactus. It might sound strange to others that I‚Äôm only opening a gift two years later, but I have quite a few toys/diy kits that have remained un-opened and I have the tendency to open those only when my mind is fully present for it.

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again and again, I‚Äôm amazed by how powerful diagramming and illustrating can be when in a group discussion. They all help increase clarity to the concepts that are being talked among.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">These past few weeks were packed with things to do and feeling excited and confused.

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm very much looking forward to the next few weeks: finally settling down in environments where I can be productive, and working with people who are also interested in working in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being in Shanghai during the end of 2018, I‚Äôve been wanting to conduct interviews with people in China and sharing those transcripts in English. I believe that by doing so, more people will be able to understand the business culture and lifestyle in China, and perhaps form different opinions about China. I was able to conduct my first interview with someone who runs a business in China (and I‚Äôm very grateful for her time and willingness to be experimental).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a recording, I‚Äôve been using different transcirption and translation products/services to help speed up the process. Having spent most of my time interfacing with english products/services over the past few years, I‚Äôm really enjoying interfacing with chinese products/services. Often times, I would notice small differences between products that serve the same purpose, but operates in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm planning on publishing an interview each month, let‚Äôs see how this will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a rocking kneel chair and an adjustable table. It‚Äôs a really nice change from constantly sitting at a fixed desk, or standing at a fixed desk. I‚Äôm only one week into this table/chair combination though, not sure how I will feel in six months.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Time has been passing by very quickly.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">It‚Äôs been a while | #21</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019-03-10/weeknotes-21" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title=" It's been a while | #21" /><published>2019-03-10T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-03-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019-03-10/weeknotes-21</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019-03-10/weeknotes-21">&lt;p&gt;Missed 3 weeknotes in the last months.

I finally got to watch spider-verse and learned about how it it illuminating uncharted territories for animations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movie had no depth of field. Instead, they used traditional comic books CMYK printing to offset and ‚Äúblur out‚Äù things that are not in focus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movie also had no motion blur. Instead, they drew multiples of the moving thing, e.g. they relied on drawing duplicates of hands to indicate hand movement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To show the clumsiness of a character, they animated it on twos, meaning showing the same frame twice (12fps instead of 24 fps). What was brilliant about it was that the character would be animated at 12fps, and the surrounding (e.g. car) would be animated at 24fps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They added so much hand-drawn comic treatment to it that, if you pause on any frame of the movie, you‚Äôd have the illusion that it‚Äôs an image of a comic, not an animated movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these animation treatments are new to the animation world, they are all classic comic books drawing technique. It‚Äôs kind of surprising to me that it took the animation industry this long to start experimenting with animation techniques. On the other hand, I can‚Äôt imagine how much politics this animation team had to push threw to be experimental with this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì
I really enjoy meeting people I‚Äôve never met before and I got to do that quite frequently over the past few weeks. It‚Äôs really nice to hang out with people who are not familiar with design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì
It‚Äôs really nice knowing how many people I know are also interested in gaining creative freedom and are willing to do something about it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting friends to respond so postively toward that career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì
It‚Äôs so much fun to think about a space. What furniture should go in there? How do I want to feel when I‚Äôm in the space? How to organize objects in a space? While I appreciate how IKEA has designed and manufactured their products, I also look forward to a day where I have a house with nothing from IKEA, I suspect it will be very challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Missed 3 weeknotes in the last months.

&lt;p&gt;Whenever people ask me which project I‚Äôm the proudest of, I have never hesitated in saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170628055307/https://www.cca.edu/news/2015/11/24/student-takes-secret-project-abroad&quot;&gt;Secret Project Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, a summer-camp-like thing I did four years ago‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past four years, I never really wrote about what the project was, and why it was a meaningful project to me, and to others. For some reason, I‚Äôve been thinking about this project a lot lately, so I decided to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sptw-360-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A static 360 photo of Secret Project Taiwan 2016&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-project-taiwan&quot;&gt;Secret Project Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout college, one of the most life-changing programs for me was called Secret Project at CCA, directed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bielenberg&quot;&gt;John Bielenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://marcobrien.net&quot;&gt;Marc O‚ÄôBrien&lt;/a&gt;. The program encouraged everyone to think wrong and to challenge the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was through Secret Project Blitzes (which were weekend workshops and spring break trips), I realized how powerful it is to dream, and to imagine, together with others:
We towed an airstream from California to Nevada to Utah and back. We got to collaborate with students from all majors, at all levels. We worked with several non-profits to brainstorm new products, marketing channels, etc. We dreamed of buying a container ship and sailing around the world (which, someone is doing a version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/100&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having gone through public and private schools in China, Secret Project was the opposite of ‚Äúlisten to your teachers, do your homework, maybe be just a little creative‚Äù culture I was used to. Participating in the Secret Project gave me ideas to run a version of it in Taiwan, where my parents are from. During the summer of 2015 and 2016, I produced and co-facilitated a 7-day workshop known as Secret Project Taiwan (SPTW), during which ~15 college students came together to think of wild ideas, make small bets, and test them out together, on a 500-acre large farm south-east of Taipei. Everyone signed up for this summer camp with the intention to practice brainstorming and pitching ideas, but it ended up being much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sptw-farm.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Day 1 of Secret Project Taiwan 2016&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Day 1 of Secret Project Taiwan 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-used-to-trying-new-things&quot;&gt;Getting used to trying new things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different from a typical college summer camp in Taiwan, SPTW was unique in a few different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was an English-speaking camp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All of us were studying in 4+ different cities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People came from 8+ different majors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was a summer camp ran by college students, for college students (the session in 2015 was facilitated by Marc O‚ÄôBrien, a CCA professor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, SPTW was a hotbed for experiments and weird and wild ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, my co-facilitators Will, Bill, and I did put some loose structure in place. Below is a screenshot of the schedule we created. While it may look intimidating, they were all fun (and occasionally nerve-wracking) activities. For example, Be Bold was a session dedicated to ‚Äúmoonshot ideas‚Äù, Let Go was a session on ‚Äúparking‚Äù our earlier ideas to come up with new ones, Small Bets was a session on creating MVPs. These are all activities part of the Think Wrong exercise, which you can learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srq7BBemFY4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also added our own flavor to the week. We introduced PechaKucha to everyone, and we all had to pitch each other our ideas with 10 slides that would each last 10 seconds. We all learned to dance to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars‚Äô Uptown Funk. We wrote a contract that said ‚ÄúI will leave humanity better then I found it,‚Äù and everyone signed it. We introduced Storytime for people to share a weird project or story with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of SPTW‚Äôs schedule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-me-your-guts&quot;&gt;Show Me Your Guts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tradition of Secret Project and its precursor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectmlab.com&quot;&gt;Project M&lt;/a&gt; was something called Show Me Your Guts, and I would like to highlight it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this event is that everyone would have 24 hours to prepare for it, and during Show Me Your Guts, we would all gather around the bonfire, and either share something we‚Äôve never said out loud before, or do something we‚Äôve never done in front of others, no exceptions. We had a bottle of whiskey, and whenever someone‚Äôs ready to show their guts, they would start their story with having one whisk of whiskey. Until they take another whisk, nobody could interrupt them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By being vulnerable in front of each other,&lt;/strong&gt; Show Me Your Guts brought all of us together in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were no longer complete strangers to each other. Instead, we each became extremely supportive, caring, and bold with what and how we brainstorm, collaborate, and make for the remaining time we had together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/guts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Show Me Your Guts from Secret Project Taiwan 2015&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Show Me Your Guts from SPTW 2015&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;missing-ingredients&quot;&gt;Missing ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 7-day workshop, everyone all got a taste of what it‚Äôs like to be bold, to collaborate, and be extremely experimental. To an extent, the workshop helped everyone to become a little more courageous, by trying new things together. However, upon leaving the SPTW and returning to each of their own lives, everyone felt that their everyday life was business-as-usual again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common feedback we received from participants, was that they all wished SPTW was a year-long gap year program, instead of a week-long ‚Äúsummer camp.‚Äù Over the past few years, I have been thinking about what it‚Äôd be like to run a more extended version of Secret Project Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would be an ideal outcome?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would everyone do every day for a few months, or for a year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having graduated from college a few months ago, I‚Äôve also been exploring what I want to devote my time to, and how I can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of environment do I wish to be in?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of people do I wish to surround myself with?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What should I devote my career to?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much autonomy do I want in the work I do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never ran another SPTW since my sophomore year, because I had to get a design internship in my junior year to graduate, and I‚Äôve been working since I‚Äôve graduated. Lately, memories from SPTW have been coming back to me, and I can‚Äôt shake the above questions off my mind. Maybe it is time for a longer version of this camp, for us all to become more courageous, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm very much looking forward to what might come out of this exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week went by really fast. I don‚Äôt feel like much happened, yet my calendar was pretty full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like I‚Äôm getting closer to doing what I‚Äôd like to do in the next phase of life. Website‚Äôs almost done thanks to teammate, got a few positive and interesting feedback from friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed a brief discussion about ‚Äòkiller app‚Äô at work. If one were to invent a medium for humanity to communicate with and think with, it is important to ask questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why and how would the society adopt this medium?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we get buy-ins from people, or what is the ‚Äòkiller app‚Äô?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To an extent, the public library or books as a medium had a ‚Äòkiller app‚Äô called the bible, disposable paper in general had a ‚Äòkiller app‚Äô where it enabled people to communiate with each other through mail and postal services.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">This is my 20th weeknotes.

&lt;p&gt;These past two weeks were a lot of absorbing and digesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended the first social systems game night in San Francisco, it was very fun to play games with people who have similar interests. Since there were ~30 people, we were divided into smaller groups, and it was fascinating to hear every group‚Äôs game results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended the first Micromobility Conference, out of curiousity, and personal interest in urban systems. It was very refreshing to be with a large group of people that aren‚Äôt primarily there to discuss design or engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, both of these events made me want to attend more first-of-its-kind event/conference more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past two weeks were also full of meeting new people and catching up with old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had dinner with some of my college friends. It‚Äôs fun to go down a memory-viewing-mode and discuss some of the things that happened in college. I always find it nice to meet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with a few groups that work for non-profit, animation company, and independent researchers. It is so refreshing and delightful to meet new people that share similar interests and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addtionally, I‚Äôm very greatful to those who offered their time to share advice, skills, and tips. Some of the conversations helped me understand that I may be better suited for operational work (with some design work invovled), some of the conversations helped me understand the possible products/services that an individual or a small team of 2-3 can build; beyond sass and physical products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs surprising to reunite with someone that I met a few years ago for a workshop, and realizing that we‚Äôve been thinking about similar things for the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also is quite magical to find or start a tribe where people are all at similar career phase, and all share similar and weird goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a friend, I‚Äôve learned quite a bit about European design culture over the past few days. It was great to learn that many design/technology people are funded by governmental grants, and that provides a completely different incentive structure for people to think and plan for their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôm now at a point where I cannot stop thinking about a model that can help people to gain creative autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Missed a week of weeknotes, so here‚Äôs a long one.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Collective creative freedom | #18</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019-01-27/weeknotes-18" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collective creative freedom | #18" /><published>2019-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019-01-27/weeknotes-18</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019-01-27/weeknotes-18">&lt;p&gt;In my weeknotes &lt;a href=&quot;http://weiweihsu.com/2018-11-10/weeknote-9&quot;&gt;#9&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about the idea creative freedom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This idea of gaining creative freedom, or research freedom, is perhaps something that I find many different communities strive for (the new indie vc movement, digital nomads, patreon creators, kickstarter creators, indie hackers, to name a few.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The question I‚Äôve been thinking about this week, in relation to creative freedom, is whether there should be a school that helps you to gain creative freedom. Job security is no longer the only goal people have for their careers. However, it is still very hard for people to wrap their head around, and be brave enough to get started with gaining creative freedom (especially those who live in an environment that culturally encourages to climb the corporate ladder, or stick with a ‚Äòsafe job‚Äô.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that Secret Project Taiwan was a step toward that direction, but currently I don‚Äôt know how I could be taking it another step furthur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 months later, I think I now have a better sense of how to begin to own creative freedom, collectively. Hopefully, I will have more to share soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot of things happened this week..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since graduation, I have been thinking a lot about what I would like to work on, and how I can get there. A few months have gone by now, and I think I‚Äôve realized that I need a balance between exploring and experimenting with tools creation, but at the same time, making it available and accessible to others. At the same time, I‚Äôve been searching for places where I can explore the intersection of computing and architecture/urbanism. I think I have found a group of people that does precisely these, and it feels like discovering earthlings when you think you are the only one residing on Mars..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a publication date for the first paper that I‚Äôve co-authored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to school to pick up my student excellence in leadership awards, and reading about why I was nominated and awarded with the awards feels like getting a flashback of everything that happened during college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, I feel a lot clearer about what I want to do and how I can get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">In my weeknotes #9, I wrote about the idea creative freedom:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Break, Home, Back | #17</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019-01-13/weeknotes-17" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Break, Home, Back | #17" /><published>2019-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019-01-13/weeknotes-17</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019-01-13/weeknotes-17">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a month since I last synced weeknotes to the website. I tried out writing weeknotes in Apple Notes for the last month and I think I still prefer writing it in Atom and pushing it to the world of connected bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a wonderful break. I was able to spend a ton of time at home, catch up with friends that I get to see once every 2-4 years, and reflect on the past few months as well as the past 4 four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some feelings:
It‚Äôs weird to be back and see how the place I grew up in feels unfamiliar because of how technology is now weaved into the city. It‚Äôs exciting to see how people that I‚Äôve crossed paths with before are all working toward their own goals. It‚Äôs motivating to see how companies here work, collaborate, and experiment to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî
I‚Äôm now at the airport. It‚Äôs been a while since I last spent this many weeks at home. And when home finally feels normal again, it‚Äôs time to leave. It feels weird to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having taken a break, where I was able to truly get bored, it‚Äôs time to get serious this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">It‚Äôs been a month since I last synced weeknotes to the website.
