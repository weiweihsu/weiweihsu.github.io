&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s been a year since I’ve graduated from college, and I’ve grown in ways I didn’t anticipate to. Through doing contract work at various organizations, I now have a better understanding of what I desire in the long-term and how I might get there.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting this month, I will be launching a product a month for the next 12 months. I’ve decided to do this in an attempt to respond to two questions I’ve had for a while:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-gaps-between-ideals-andreality&quot;&gt;1. Gaps between ideals and reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban planning, people-computer interaction, and education are all topics that I’m broadly interested in and would like to contribute to in my lifetime. One thing that has struck me is how many strong recommendations and investigations have been proposed and conducted in the past few decades, even centuries. Yet, most of those (utopian) proposals are never realized. I’ve been asking myself: “How can we begin to narrow the gap between ideals and reality, and the gap between academic and industry?” I don’t have an answer yet, but I have 2 hypotheses that I’d like to test out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideals-as-culturalmovement&quot;&gt;→ &lt;strong&gt;Ideals as cultural movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to narrow the gap between ideals and reality, ideals need to become a cultural movement or a lifestyle (for example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theminimalists.com/&quot;&gt;The Minimalists&lt;/a&gt;), in a language that non-experts can understand, internalize, and even become an ambassador of. This requires us to expand upon our current sets of vocabularies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often hard to invent new vocabularies, but having new vocabularies (and hence new lifestyle) takes on a crucial role in expanding what we perceive as possible. Two movements/lifestyle that is relatively new is the minimalism (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theminimalists.com/&quot;&gt;The Minimalists&lt;/a&gt;, Marie Kondo, and others), as well as the maker movement (thanks to Fablab, MAKE, and others). What’s successful about both of these movements is that the name is rather catchy, and easy to remember and to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to underline the importance of branding and communication work is to think about the emotions you feel when you hear [net neutrality] vs [internet discrimination], and the difference between [uploading a folder to the cloud] vs [sending a folder to a data server] (many people I’ve talked to seriously thought they were uploading data to the clouds in the sky).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideals-as-bite-sized-initiatives&quot;&gt;→ &lt;strong&gt;Ideals as bite-sized initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to narrow the gap between ideals and reality, ideals need to be introduced to the world in bite-size. Often times, it is hard for people to relate to a truly new (and different) future and it is even harder for people to integrate that future into their lives in a short period of time. As a result, ideals should be introduced in smaller chunks, so that it’s “digestible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company that inspired this thinking was &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookingglassfactory.com/&quot;&gt;Looking Glass Factory&lt;/a&gt; and their journey to build holographic displays. They started by offering volumetric 3d prints, and snowballed their product into something that’s closer to their initial goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tf_lookingglass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there’s quite a bit of branding and communication work that’s required to translate an ideal into something comprehendible, and actionable.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-creating-on-our-ownterms&quot;&gt;2. Creating on our own terms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound naive, but one of the surprises I faced transitioning from school to the professional world was my lack of creative independence. When starting out at an entry-level position, you (obviously) don’t get to make the rules and call the shots. However, I find that I work better when I work and operate in an environment that’s permission-less. My best projects all stemmed from asking the question “What if?” and going full-speed ahead and trying things out. Understandably, at work, there are also several financial and organizational constraints that requires projects and experimental ideas to evolve at a different pace. While there’s nothing wrong with that, I began to ask myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What does it take to build a permission-less career?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tf_bbcube.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ex: Behind-the-scenes of shipping BBCube, a successfully crowdfunded tabletop game full of loud and frenzied collaboration and communication.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-a-leap-offaith&quot;&gt;Making a leap of faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After evaluating and exploring different paths, I think I’ve settled on something I would like to try. I’ve found a few peers who are also interested in gaining creative independence. Together, we will experiment with a collaborative incubator model where we will help each other transition into exploring and launching indie products full-time. In order to avoid some of the unnecessary stress and competitive culture that other environments may have, we’ve also agreed on a revenue-sharing model that will encourage all of us to collaborate and support each other. (This was partially inspired by the model that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/7b22f38ff495&quot;&gt;Otherlab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/2932d151e989&quot;&gt;Indie.vc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://earnestcapital.com/&quot;&gt;Earnest Capital&lt;/a&gt; operates with.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tf_products.png&quot; alt=&quot;Small scale products and workshops we have worked on in the past.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/3627bb308c03&quot;&gt;Tomo Kihara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/5d5ef26897a1&quot;&gt;William Felker&lt;/a&gt;, me and other like-minded people will work inter-dependently to make and launch software, hardware, softgoods, workshops, every month, under the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyfactories.space/&quot;&gt;Tiny Factories&lt;/a&gt;. With this model, we hope that we will be able to blend the boundaries of making, learning, and communicating in order to explore our relationship with and collective contribution to the world.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;becoming-courageous-together&quot;&gt;Becoming courageous, together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tf_ryanhoover.png&quot; alt=&quot;A tweet from Ryan Hoover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Founder of Product Hunt &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/c2146664c8e4&quot;&gt;Ryan Hoover&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1127639391365627904&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “I wish more people worked on things they truly enjoyed.” There are countless reasons why so few of us are living a lifestyle we truly enjoy. While acknowledging that it is already a privilege to be able to think about this, I often wonder what it takes for people to switch careers or lifestyle to achieve that enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people, including me, have many ideas or (career) paths that we would like to explore. However, those paths often require making a risky change in life that very few end up pursuing what they are truly interested in, early in their life. If making a leap of faith is easier with other people, then why not find a group of people to do it together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2015 and 2016, I tested this out with a group of similar-age strangers in Taiwan. Those were the best two summers I’ve had in my life. You can learn more about that &lt;a href=&quot;http://weiweihsu.com/2019-02-20/becoming-courageous-together&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-to-build-inpublic&quot;&gt;Learn to build in public&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has been living in the Bay Area for 4+ years, I find that most people prefer to make a &lt;em&gt;big reveal&lt;/em&gt; rather than sharing as they are building. There are several psychological reasons behind that. However, I’m interested in being more transparent, and sharing both the ups and the downs of my journey of becoming (or failing to become) creatively and financially independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very much looking forward to this opportunity for me to explore a wide range of projects: products/services that are physical, analogue, digital, general-purpose, single-purpose, self-serve, useful, useless, timely, timeless, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every product, I’m also planning to release a video that captures and shares the details of a project in ways a blog post or a tweet cannot encapsulate. I’ve always had an interest in videos and animations and this will be a chance for me to learn all of that!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-meaningful&quot;&gt;Is this meaningful?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago, someone asked me, and I para-phrase:” On your Twitter profile, you said that you are interested in self-actualization, urban systems, and augmenting human intellect. How does, say, launching a design plugin, align with those goals and interests?” It is a great question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breaker.audio/venture-stories/e/46331227&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/8bd20f383de4&quot;&gt;Tim O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt; discussed the importance to expand the vocabularies (and hence mindsets) we have. One of my meta-goal here is to expand the vocabularies regarding two aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Possible career paths: Though my medium-term goal is to work on energy-first and privacy-first projects, I believe I will be more useful if I can practice making, launching, improving, marketing, selling products in a monthly-cycle, because all of those are muscles that I need to exercise, ideally as early and as often. This will not only create opportunities for practicing launching into different markets, but also leave room for products to breathe, and grow organically over time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ways to communicate with the larger world: Technology is going to be even more intertwined in our lives. One pattern I’ve noticed is that a digital product or service is often treated as a 100% technology project. It’s only until recently, that more and more people are realizing that as much as a product is a technology project, it’s also a social project, a cultural project, a political project, an environmental project, and [insert a humanity characteristic], so I think it is important for me (and for others) to learn and take risk at a scale that doesn’t cost other people’s lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as there’s a larger goal here, I will be starting small. What I do in the next 6 or even 12 months may look no where near the goals I’ve described here. We will see.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times, I hear the phrase “go big or go home”. I’ve been wondering, what if, for some of the work that I do, I want to neither go big nor go home? This might be fairly counter-intuitive given where I live right now. However, I believe there are a lot of people who are interested in creating/investigating on their own terms, and the common connotation is that you can only do so by saving a ton and later burn through those savings comfortably. I would like to see an alternative future where anyone who would like to create on their own terms can do so by having some support structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone should have a chance in unlocking their own creative potential, as early as they’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s always a journey, or a hike before you can reach where you are aiming for. To be honest, I’m very nervous and excited about this; there are many skills that are needed for launching successful products that I don’t have yet. However, I feel that this is a now or never thing. While I’m still young, and have little strings attached, I want to do something I’m unlikely to do in 20 years. If this is even mildly successful, I will then focus on more complex projects/products that require more dedicated attention.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-us-at-tiny-factories&quot;&gt;Join us at Tiny Factories!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a lot to figure out, and that’s why we’ve created a space for us to experiment and learn a lot in a rather short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s finally sinking into my current lifestyle. Now that I’m independent (for who knows how long), I need to be disciplined and organize my time so that I can get work done, eat healthily, meet up with friends, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I have endless things to do, so I suppose that will keep me busy for a while. :)&lt;/p&gt;

Something one of my teacher from college said, that left a deep impression with me, was along the line of :”If I can start a major, I would call it [Performing Arts] and we can just experiment with different ideas on stage or in real life.” I’ve always loved that idea of the process and outcomes of interaction design are performances. Whether you are pitching an idea, showing your best friends around your city, or rallying a team to accomplish a milestone, you are putting on a show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking proved to work well when I presented my senior thesis by acting out as a computer. Although I didn’t translate those content for other platforms, I think creating content online (or even running a company) would also benefit from thinking about theatrical performances. Perhaps this is why Ted Nelson said computers are a branch of filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking also aligns with how Disney structure their organization. They call all of their customers, regardless of which service/product they are referring to, their guests. If they are guests, they are here for an experience, and you as hosts should do your best in making sure they feel comfortable and have a good time. They also call their employees crew member, instead of staff. As a crew member, you are part of a larger team that’s putting on a show, you represent the larger identity that the team has crafted. So when you wear your uniform, you represent all of your fellow crew members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love this metaphor, something that I still don’t understand though, is how and if this metaphor is euqally effective when addressing larger and more complex challenges like climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching America and Britain’s got talent this past two weeks. I remember seeing snippets of them in highschool but I didn’t pay much attention to them. Lately, as I’ve been thinking about more about movements and ways to inspire others, I find the auditions on these shows being particularly relevant. The energy that the comedians, singers, dancers, magicians, and others brought to the show are infectious (in a really good way).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been thinking about the idea of performing.

In retrospect that’s not really possible, because half baked thoughts are just really loose. However, what I’ve noticed is that, by writing more frequently, I’m able to think more clearly in terms of when I started thinking about a new thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about how to come up with new terms. New phrases are often needed to describe a new combination of activity or thinking, but it’s hard to understand what will stick. Metaphors or mashing two words together often work well. Some friends and I tried to brainstorm around something that we are working on, and it’s really hard to come up with a new name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started growing mushrooms about 10 days ago. And it’s going pretty well given that it’s my first time? I wish there wasn’t the heat wave in bay area cause the mushrooms starting looking weird because of the heat wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milk tea with brown sugar has been pretty popular in China lately. I never tried it when I was there earlier in the year. I bought one a few weeks for the first time and they are surprinsgly good given how ordinary the ingredients are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a hike with college roommates last week and it was really fun! We got to fly the drone a little more and just spend time in a signal-free environment. Sometimes it’s hard to remind myself how fun it can be to hideaway from cities for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hiking.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;hiking with friends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got to play with some moment lens and it’s really fun to see tiny details in the world. I’ve been comparing different cameras lately and looking at the type of cameras different type of people use. It’s fascinating to see the wide range of cameras out there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">When I first set up this website for writing weeknotes, I thought I could jot down notes while linking different thoughts with different hashtags.

&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation with someone and we talked about the differences between a lab and a group that invents a new medium (writing, book, printing press, personal computer, essentially a new way to communicate without being bounded by time and space (?)). I thought that that’s a fascinating distinction. Historically speaking, a technology lab is a place where people gather to investigate a computing-related questions. What they do with the results of that investigation is sometimes less important (most of the time a different stakeholder go do something with that). In the case where Dynamicland claims to be inventing a new medium, it needs to be operating in a way that’s different from how a lab operates. By claiming to be inventing a new medium, you are also suggesting that what you invent will be threaded into our daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

Partially because I sometimes don’t know what to write about. So I’m trying a different approach: Everytime I’m writing weeknotes, I’m going to open the photos apps and select photos of activies that I want to share. I wonder if this will get me back on track with writing weekly weeknotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was the last week of school at CCA. I can’t believe it’s already been a year since I’ve graduated. In the past year, I’ve learned a lot and went through many different things that I didn’t expect to. More on that in a blog post later…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been enjoying riding the new BART trains. I wish there’s a timetable where I can see where all the new BART trains are, I’m pretty sure I will make sure I only ride the new ones.. They are so much quieter and brighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bart.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;new BART trains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconfigured the plant shelve at home and started planted the end parts of chives and other vegetables to grow some food at home. It’s suprising how calming I become when I can see plants in my peripheral vision while working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also loving the flexiblility and accessibility of cardboard, wood square dowel, and milk crates. I think I will try and make most of my home furniture and storage spaces with those materials in the future.. I don’t think this will work for those who have small kids at home, or those who are living in the same place for 10+ years. In my case, I’ve been moving every 1-3 years. Whenver I move, I can recycle/re-sell these materials for others to use in different ways. I can also create laser cut, cnc, and 3d printing designs and re-use them everytime I move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended my college roommate’s film screening and her film was so great! Funny that we all presented our thesis in the same room, but one year apart. I’ve been thinking about how Ted Nelson said “Computer graphics is really a branch of movie-making.” I really like film as a medium for communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ccascreening.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;film screening&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also kind of unfortuante that the longer I’ve been out of school, the less faces I recognize everytime I go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to Exploratorium on Thursday for a talk by Scott McCloud and a talk on personalizing Climate Change. It was really nice to hear those talks in person. I really enjoyed both of those talks (in different ways).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion I had with a friend afterwards was around presentation effort. We both don’t feel like people (generally speaking) put enough effort into preparing a presentation. Really, a presentation is a performance, but most people put together with the mindset “I’m told I need to summarize something I’ve been working on.” If more people treat presentation giving as movie making, I think we will have a ton more great and enjoyable presentations in the world..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to SFMoMA with two friends over the weekend. Their new exhibitions on Snap &amp;amp; Share  (the evolution of sharing photographs) as well as Sea Ranch were both really enjoyable. Everytime I’m there, I can sense the shifts in art museums. There are definitely certain types of exhibitions that are getting more and more popular (because they resonate with our current lives) and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s nice to just relax and read books and play games 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently wrapped up a housing releated project with a few friends. Feels nice to have delivered something different. The exhibition we installed looks like a render because we painted everything in the same color. In retrospect, it doesn’t feel like the presentation was as important, because the event was much more focused on which teams are winning the award this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/house9.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;housing project's installation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A realization I had recently: I should be working on things that I can personally have the most (positive) impact on, given my set of experiences and skills. There are many topic areas that I’m personally interested in, but if I don’t have any leverage over it, or if I don’t know what I can do tomorrow, it’s worth it to park the idea for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While commuting, I listened to a podcast where Tim Ferris interviewed Eric Schmidt. Part of the interview was spent discussing about a new book called “A Trillion Dollar Coach”. I’ve never really thought about the differences between a coach and a mentor in a business context. I really like the idea that as an organization, the goal is to succeed as a team, not to have one person who performs well independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started reading about the differences between doing a listening session vs an interview. Feels like there’re significant differences between the two, though they may sound similar to most people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Haven’t had a relatively calming weekend in a few months.

Went to a few events, worked on projects, made some more progress with work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started thinking about making small custom fixtures that make home more interesting; including a cluster of pc fans that serve as an air conditioner to cool the space down. Over the next few weeks, I will be prototyping a light bulb holder (a.k.a a lamp) that’s made out of cardboard. I think it will be very cool to make a repository of furniture/objects that make a living or working environment more usable and playful.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pcfan.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;pc fan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended an event hosted by CCA Architecture Division two weeks ago on co-living. I really appreciated how candid the conversations there were. My main takeaway is: co-living isn’t real unless people who share the living spaces are also those who have ownership in the real estate.

&lt;p&gt;This is a Christmas gift I got two years ago and I finally opened it to ‘grow’ the cactus. It might sound strange to others that I’m only opening a gift two years later, but I have quite a few toys/diy kits that have remained un-opened and I have the tendency to open those only when my mind is fully present for it.

&lt;p&gt;I’m very much looking forward to the next few weeks: finally settling down in environments where I can be productive, and working with people who are also interested in working in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being in Shanghai during the end of 2018, I’ve been wanting to conduct interviews with people in China and sharing those transcripts in English. I believe that by doing so, more people will be able to understand the business culture and lifestyle in China, and perhaps form different opinions about China. I was able to conduct my first interview with someone who runs a business in China (and I’m very grateful for her time and willingness to be experimental).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a recording, I’ve been using different transcirption and translation products/services to help speed up the process. Having spent most of my time interfacing with english products/services over the past few years, I’m really enjoying interfacing with chinese products/services. Often times, I would notice small differences between products that serve the same purpose, but operates in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on publishing an interview each month, let’s see how this will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a rocking kneel chair and an adjustable table. It’s a really nice change from constantly sitting at a fixed desk, or standing at a fixed desk. I’m only one week into this table/chair combination though, not sure how I will feel in six months.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Time has been passing by very quickly.</summary></entry></feed>
