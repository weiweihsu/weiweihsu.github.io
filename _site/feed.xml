I spent much less time thinking and a lot more time executing. It feels nice to balance the week with some making, and shipping. It also feels nice to see a project coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a design school, many students (including me) talk about the want to start our own (design-related) thing. Earlier in the week, I was asked if that desire comes from wanting to extend what I felt and experienced in school, because you then become a small consulting firm. Whereas, if the desire comes from wanting to build a business that can scale, then the work/commitment required is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people talk about world views. I wonder if there’s such thing as world heights. Do we think and operate at different world heights, due to what we’ve been exposed to? How are world heights different from world views?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I gave a tour at the &amp;amp;lab to a group of foreigners. Toward the end of the tour, they mentioned that they rarely interfaced with women when they were in SF, visiting different kinds of organizations. I genuinely wish that won’t be case in the near future. Now that I have worked at a few different environments (each for a relatively short period of time), I see how problematic this is, and observe how often I feel defeated as someone who has a “softer” voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since graduation, I’ve been building physical things, and it requires significantly more work. Yet, it feels so much more satisfying to make real objects. While a good group of people are advocating for virtual and augmented reality, I wonder what it takes for the reality to revenge. In my head, I sometimes compare the world of Harry Potter to the world of Ready Player One, and the former just feels more magical to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">This week feels like a week of production work.

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently half way through “Architectural Intelligence” by Molly Wright Steenson. Since the beginning of my senior year, I have been fascinated by the relationship between the bits and atoms, the physical and the digital, the architectural and the computational. At some point, I would love to go to (or help create) a grad school that offers something in between, instead of one or the other. I also hope that, my senior thesis on “The “Space” of Computing” is only the beginning of my investigation in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I feel that the real definition of architecture is that which through a natural distortion of time, place, and interval creates beneficial social conditions that hitherto were considered impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quote above, I find it curious that he defined architecture as a way to &lt;em&gt;distort&lt;/em&gt; time, place, and interval. To an extend, the word “distort” feels more intentional, genuine, speculative, and playful than words like “intervene”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Price’s work the purpose of technology was “to take part in the architectural debate, perhaps through contribution, disputation, or the ability to shock.” Price used technology as a provocation for change — change in the design process, change in how people interacted with buildings and cities, change in the status quo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, this is what (feels to me) is missing in today’s digital design. Technology has “the ability to shock” and can be used “as a provocation for change”. Digital design today does the opposite of creating “space” for people to reflect. Instead, we’ve been architecting digital “spaces” so that the paths are fixed, and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/digital_is_physical.png&quot; alt=&quot;kiosk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, (this comma separates notes from different days)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does one need to make sacrifice(s) by making a vision real? Recently, I’ve had several discussions about the difference between doing research or academic work versus making products that will participate in people’s everyday life. It seems like, those who prefer to do research, believe that (commercial) products cannot fully represent the vision, and those who work on products that are shipping, believe that research is conceptual and ‘fluffy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an in-between? Can we introduce speculative work into people’s everyday life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my senior thesis, I struggled tremendously in translating what I was thinking into something others could relate to, and hence begin to care about. I asked myself, do I care if others don’t understand it? And I cared. I ended up acting out as a computer and shared that as a computer, I wish that my relationship with you will be more than what it is right now. In retrospect, if I chose not to translate my thinking/work into something that’s relatable and understandable, I would have done zero work, or at least that’s my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If a tree falls in the forest, and nobody heard it, did it make a sound?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If someone has done work, and nobody understands it, was the work done?” I’m pretty sure my answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">“Technology is the answer, but what was the question?” Cedric Price asked.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Four years, post-college, freelancing, collective | #1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018-09-15/weeknote-1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Four years, post-college, freelancing, collective | #1 " /><published>2018-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018-09-15/weeknote-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018-09-15/weeknote-1">&lt;p&gt;It has been 4 months since I’ve graduated from college, and 4 years since I’ve graduated from high school. Time flies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I graduated from high school, college graduation sounded faraway. Yet, here I am. Looking back at the past four years, I’m certain that I’ve learned a lot, about relationships, industries, personalities, interactions, and more. I’m also certain that I’ve lost a few qualities that I used to possess, perhaps in an unfortunate way. For example, I find myself becoming a little more practical and less experimental than three years ago. I hope that by being aware of this, I will find myself being more wild than I currently am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, in college, I was being cautioned that I should care more about those around me. I think I now am better at identifying when I should care more, but still need to be more proactive in caring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since returning from summer travels, I’ve taken on a few contracting positions. Freelancing right out of school in some way forces myself to pick up a few skills quickly, because I’m not shielded by a consultancy. Being challenged feels great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;OhDotZero recently finished our first project; two kiosks for the Global Climate Action Summit. At the kiosk, you can pick your miniature home appliances and place them onto the floor plan to see how much energy and water you use. To make the numbers more relatable, we converted kwh and gallons of water into number of iphone charges and bottles of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kiosk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kiosk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the two kiosks look cute and well put-together. I personally also learned a lot about where I fall short and strive when it comes to collaborating and delegating. Additionally, it also made me realize (once again) just how much more I need to learn; both soft and hard skills wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;Lab got paused for a little bit because of the recent &amp;amp;OhDotZero project. Self-starting something, even with friends, is hard. There are no formal deadlines, which makes everything too flexible. Sometimes, I wish there’s a school that would let you graduate only if your collective/business is self-sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/calendar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kiosk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since senior year, I’ve been taping a four-month calendar to the top of my laptop, to keep track of deadlines and to-dos. It helped me tremendously in acknowledging and acting on the to-dos for my thesis. However, this calendar hasn’t been as effective now. Perhaps because my to-dos are all listed on the page, instead of associated with a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve always remembered from my dad is that, life isn’t fair, the only thing that’s fair is that everyone has 24 hours. And perhaps that’s why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62CUg45lMtQ&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Devinsupertramps’ video resonates with me so much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">It has been 4 months since I’ve graduated from college, and 4 years since I’ve graduated from high school.
