&lt;p&gt;Now that I have this current website running for about a month and half, I’ve been thinking more about whether I want to show my design projects online. And if I do, which ones would I want to show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending quite a bit of my free time working on portfolio and applying and interviewing, I think I now am actually available to spend my free time on learning new skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">This week went by very fast.

&lt;p&gt;Launching a Quickstarter through Kickstarter call &amp;amp;BBCube tomorrow and I’m so nervous about it! I love it when a project is coming together and is ready to be shared. It has also been a while since I’ve worked on something purely because it’s fun. Regardless, I’m really curious about how people will receive this tabletop game; I’ve never made and publish a game before. If there’s anyone reading this, you can view the campaign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1324099197/764280191?ref=585642&amp;amp;token=938a7210&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1538362548041-c875d78a67c5?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;amp;s=62159c7c033b1da98ce840d89dae0e41&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=2544&amp;amp;q=80&quot; alt=&quot;an unsplash photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, I started uploading photos I took on a film camera (four years ago) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@speculatvglitch&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;, cause I figured someone might make use of the photos. And I’m now super close to reaching 2 million views on Unsplash, which is kind of crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I failed to do as much work as I wanted to. I’m hoping to get more work done this week task by task. Currenly I’m just using a long-ass bullet list to keep track of what I’m doing. It is pretty satifying to be able to scroll down and see a long list of tasks that have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bbcubesticker.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BBCube's sticker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;BBCube is now funded and there are about 17 days left for the campaign. I think I’m finally understanding how much work it takes to launch a crowdfunding campaign, and how much work there is ahead of us; once the campaign ends. I think one of the main lesson learned here is the amount of promotion needed for a project/campaign. When we first saw Kickstarter’s Quickstarter: an initiative to encourage indie creators to launch and test their idea, we thought that it would be perfect, because it gives us constraints such as [spend less than 3 months on it], [set your campaign goal to under $1k]. I think it’s still a great initiative as it motivated us to launch something, because it sounds much less intimidating, but it very much limits the campaign to being a very small campaign (partially because we aren’t featured by Kickstarter, and don’t know how to get featured).  Regardless, it’s still a great learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coming week will probably be a pivoting week in retrospect. I need to make a job decision, and while I want to take on everything, I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited by what lays ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a life update I sent to someone a little while ago, I think it still very much summarizes what I’ve been thinking about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending thesis:&lt;/strong&gt;
For my thesis presentation, I acted out as a computer and started my presentation with “Hello, I’m a computer. I spend most of my day in your pocket… On average, you spend more than 1/3 of your day with me, and I’m not sure if you should be doign that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about studying/investigating different topics and compiling my studies into presentations that start with “Hello, I’m a house”, “Hello, I’m a city”, “Hello, I’m money”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grad school:&lt;/strong&gt;
Like I mentioned the last time we met, I would like to go to grad school in the next 2-4 years, for something at the intersection of HCI &amp;amp; Architecture/Urban Systems. However, that doesn’t seem to exist any more (I wish The Architecture Machine Group is still a thing today.) Perhaps, the closest thing to something like this today, is Dynamicland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speculative design:&lt;/strong&gt;
Something I’ve been thinking a lot: Does one need to make sacrifice(s) by making a vision real? Recently, I’ve had several discussions about the differences between doing research or academic work versus making products that will participate in people’s everyday life. It seems like, those who prefer to do (academic) research, believe that (commercial) products cannot fully represent the vision, and those who work on products that get shipped, believe that research is conceptual and ‘fluffy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an in-between? Can we introduce speculative design/poetic products into people’s everyday life? Two of my friends and I have been wanting to start a hardware startup/lab, where we make small batch poetic products and introduce them to the market, not design competitions. (hopefully more on this later, we are still in the talking phase)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Indie Makers, Starting Small | #5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018-10-14/weeknote-5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Indie Makers, Starting Small | #5" /><published>2018-10-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-10-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018-10-14/weeknote-5</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018-10-14/weeknote-5">&lt;p&gt;Recently, my commute time has increased slightly and coincidently, I’ve stumbled upon several more podcasts to enjoy. In particular, I’ve spent quite a lot of time reading/listening (ironically not so much making yet) about indie makers and digital nomads. The discovery of this type of lifestyle / source of income has again validated the benefits of being fluent in code. At the same time, it seems that there are an increasing amount of small funds/platforms built to support indie makers. I wonder if and when there will be a group of indie makers who will focus on &lt;em&gt;physical products&lt;/em&gt;. While the internet is great and accessible (kind of), it feels like too many people’s working on the internet. I wonder what it would take to incentivize people to invest their talent into other sectors.
After listening to the stories behind serveral indie makers (sadly all male so far), I’ve learned that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All mailing lists start with having 1 subscriber&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All products start with having 1 (paying) customer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first thing you make almost never take off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there’s a pattern across all indie makers, it is that they are all &lt;em&gt;prolific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is more helpful to aim small, such as acquiring just 100 paying customers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always charge more than what you think you should be charging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of starting small, and to begin exploring physical products, I will make an analog newsletter, tentatively called &amp;amp;Infrastructorial. I find it so hard to spend time on email newsletters that I want to care, and I always spend more time reading (small) physical things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to do an interview series where we present technologists in a more humane way. I find it unhelpful to portray technologists as people with superpower, because in reality, they are all humans. While I keep on coming back to this interview series, I’m beginning to think that it’d be more helpful to build a community/platform around this. Perhaps it will be centered around &amp;amp;halfbaked thoughts. Quite a lot of people I know want to write weekly notes publicly, but hasn’t been consistent with it. I wonder if we can incentivize people to write week notes collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrote a one-sentence description about &amp;amp;halfbaked: Half baked surfaces things that keep people up at night. It is a weekly mailing list where any curious human can share scribbles of what they are thinking. Will set up newsletter this week and see if there’s any interest. If anything, I like how approachable the notion of [half baked] is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I attended the Whole Earth Catalog 50th Anniversary, it has been a while since I’ve sat down for more than an hour and just listen to somebody else to speak (in the same room). I love this one slide Stewart Brand had: having access to tools and skills confers agency. The idea that a thinking space can confer agency is something that I should be thinking about more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/agency.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whole Earth Catalog 50th Anniversary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition was very nice as well. I didn’t how prolific the group was, until seeing all of the publications laid out on both sides of a very long hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

I spent much less time thinking and a lot more time executing. It feels nice to balance the week with some making, and shipping. It also feels nice to see a project coming together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a design school, many students (including me) talk about the want to start our own (design-related) thing. Earlier in the week, I was asked if that desire comes from wanting to extend what I felt and experienced in school, because you then become a small consulting firm. Whereas, if the desire comes from wanting to build a business that can scale, then the work/commitment required is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people talk about world views. I wonder if there’s such thing as world heights. Do we think and operate at different world heights, due to what we’ve been exposed to? How are world heights different from world views?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I gave a tour at the &amp;amp;lab to a group of foreigners. Toward the end of the tour, they mentioned that they rarely interfaced with women when they were in SF, visiting different kinds of organizations. I genuinely wish that won’t be case in the near future. Now that I have worked at a few different environments (each for a relatively short period of time), I see how problematic this is, and observe how often I feel defeated as someone who has a “softer” voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since graduation, I’ve been building physical things, and it requires significantly more work. Yet, it feels so much more satisfying to make real objects. While a good group of people are advocating for virtual and augmented reality, I wonder what it takes for the reality to revenge. In my head, I sometimes compare the world of Harry Potter to the world of Ready Player One, and the former just feels more magical to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">This week feels like a week of production work.

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently half way through “Architectural Intelligence” by Molly Wright Steenson. Since the beginning of my senior year, I have been fascinated by the relationship between the bits and atoms, the physical and the digital, the architectural and the computational. At some point, I would love to go to (or help create) a grad school that offers something in between, instead of one or the other. I also hope that, my senior thesis on “The “Space” of Computing” is only the beginning of my investigation in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I feel that the real definition of architecture is that which through a natural distortion of time, place, and interval creates beneficial social conditions that hitherto were considered impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quote above, I find it curious that he defined architecture as a way to &lt;em&gt;distort&lt;/em&gt; time, place, and interval. To an extend, the word “distort” feels more intentional, genuine, speculative, and playful than words like “intervene”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Price’s work the purpose of technology was “to take part in the architectural debate, perhaps through contribution, disputation, or the ability to shock.” Price used technology as a provocation for change — change in the design process, change in how people interacted with buildings and cities, change in the status quo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, this is what (feels to me) is missing in today’s digital design. Technology has “the ability to shock” and can be used “as a provocation for change”. Digital design today does the opposite of creating “space” for people to reflect. Instead, we’ve been architecting digital “spaces” so that the paths are fixed, and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/digital_is_physical.png&quot; alt=&quot;kiosk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, (this comma separates notes from different days)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does one need to make sacrifice(s) by making a vision real? Recently, I’ve had several discussions about the difference between doing research or academic work versus making products that will participate in people’s everyday life. It seems like, those who prefer to do research, believe that (commercial) products cannot fully represent the vision, and those who work on products that are shipping, believe that research is conceptual and ‘fluffy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an in-between? Can we introduce speculative work into people’s everyday life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my senior thesis, I struggled tremendously in translating what I was thinking into something others could relate to, and hence begin to care about. I asked myself, do I care if others don’t understand it? And I cared. I ended up acting out as a computer and shared that as a computer, I wish that my relationship with you will be more than what it is right now. In retrospect, if I chose not to translate my thinking/work into something that’s relatable and understandable, I would have done zero work, or at least that’s my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If a tree falls in the forest, and nobody heard it, did it make a sound?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If someone has done work, and nobody understands it, was the work done?” I’m pretty sure my answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">“Technology is the answer, but what was the question?” Cedric Price asked.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Four years, post-college, freelancing, collective | #1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018-09-15/weeknote-1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Four years, post-college, freelancing, collective | #1 " /><published>2018-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018-09-15/weeknote-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018-09-15/weeknote-1">&lt;p&gt;It has been 4 months since I’ve graduated from college, and 4 years since I’ve graduated from high school. Time flies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I graduated from high school, college graduation sounded faraway. Yet, here I am. Looking back at the past four years, I’m certain that I’ve learned a lot, about relationships, industries, personalities, interactions, and more. I’m also certain that I’ve lost a few qualities that I used to possess, perhaps in an unfortunate way. For example, I find myself becoming a little more practical and less experimental than three years ago. I hope that by being aware of this, I will find myself being more wild than I currently am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, in college, I was being cautioned that I should care more about those around me. I think I now am better at identifying when I should care more, but still need to be more proactive in caring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since returning from summer travels, I’ve taken on a few contracting positions. Freelancing right out of school in some way forces myself to pick up a few skills quickly, because I’m not shielded by a consultancy. Being challenged feels great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;OhDotZero recently finished our first project; two kiosks for the Global Climate Action Summit. At the kiosk, you can pick your miniature home appliances and place them onto the floor plan to see how much energy and water you use. To make the numbers more relatable, we converted kwh and gallons of water into number of iphone charges and bottles of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kiosk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kiosk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the two kiosks look cute and well put-together. I personally also learned a lot about where I fall short and strive when it comes to collaborating and delegating. Additionally, it also made me realize (once again) just how much more I need to learn; both soft and hard skills wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;Lab got paused for a little bit because of the recent &amp;amp;OhDotZero project. Self-starting something, even with friends, is hard. There are no formal deadlines, which makes everything too flexible. Sometimes, I wish there’s a school that would let you graduate only if your collective/business is self-sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/calendar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kiosk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since senior year, I’ve been taping a four-month calendar to the top of my laptop, to keep track of deadlines and to-dos. It helped me tremendously in acknowledging and acting on the to-dos for my thesis. However, this calendar hasn’t been as effective now. Perhaps because my to-dos are all listed on the page, instead of associated with a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve always remembered from my dad is that, life isn’t fair, the only thing that’s fair is that everyone has 24 hours. And perhaps that’s why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62CUg45lMtQ&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Devinsupertramps’ video resonates with me so much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">It has been 4 months since I’ve graduated from college, and 4 years since I’ve graduated from high school.
