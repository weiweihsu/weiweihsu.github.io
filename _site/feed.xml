I kind of wanted to keep on doing that lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that I’ve learned in the last year. Some are definitely things I wish I don’t need to learn, but I suppose it’s better to learn those lessons now than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–
I feel that I’m pretty productive at airports, maybe I should try and get to airports several hours earlier in the future ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus (most) airports have tasty food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked into a Cabela’s (a store that has hunting and camping equipments) for the first time. On one side of the shelve there are unicorn plush toys, on the other shelve there are real guns.

They are funded by supporters on patreon and they gave a talk at XOXO on how they changed their lifestyle to adapt to living on a boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until watching this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; that I actually got to learn more about them. (I know, I could have put into more effort in reading and watching the content they’ve put out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things that we take for granted by living in cities, things i didn’t really think about until watching this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they can’t use adobe products offline because their software need to connect to internet to check your subscription&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they create software that require little computer processing and throttle their computers’ CPU so that their electronics can be powered by solar panel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they need to put away electronics in containers, otherwise the electronics rust easily when sailing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any bio waste that they produce need to be stored on boat (i think)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they take turn to sleep for 3 hours at a time because they need to monitor their sailing direction frequently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they only use their computer when the sun is out because that’s when they can get power from the solar panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really really motivates me to think about living style and computers differently. 🍀 What’s the relationship we want to (and perhaps should) have with nature, and computers? When will the chase for faster, better, thinner, lighter devices slow down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to think more about what I might want as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live in the woods or on a boat for half the year, live in cities for the other half&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dwell in off-the-grid housing (think Gates Foudnation’s toilet challenge, but applied to all appliances and housing infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have (computer) devices that are modular, and single-tasked if I desire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devices can do file/data hand-off easily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe only one of the device can go online, the rest stays offline or local (mesh network)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information I’m hanlding (writing, coding, designing etc) can be easily “imported and exported” between the digital and the real world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s a future where just enough technology is what we desire, but to get there, we might need hard science and technology research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four of us have been building products every week in the last month. It’s been really fun and I feel like I’m almost learning as much as I was in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that the last time I was this happy is probably the summer of 2018 – it’s been a while. Perhaps this is the process of understanding myself and learning to advocate for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to become a little more active on Twitter, treating it as a bookmarking and notetaking place. We will see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really enjoying this path of taking things one step at a time. It feels good knowing that with each project I’m learning something new, and overtime these learnings will compound.s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I’m really grateful for the projects and classes I worked on and took. Those learnings are really informing what I’m doing now. (For example, leaving time for teammates to get to know each other, because the goal is to go far, not go fast.)&lt;/p&gt;
