&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s finally sinking into my current lifestyle. Now that I’m independent (for who knows how long), I need to be disciplined and organize my time so that I can get work done, eat healthily, meet up with friends, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I have endless things to do, so I suppose that will keep me busy for a while. :)&lt;/p&gt;

Something one of my teacher from college said, that left a deep impression with me, was along the line of :”If I can start a major, I would call it [Performing Arts] and we can just experiment with different ideas on stage or in real life.” I’ve always loved that idea of the process and outcomes of interaction design are performances. Whether you are pitching an idea, showing your best friends around your city, or rallying a team to accomplish a milestone, you are putting on a show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking proved to work well when I presented my senior thesis by acting out as a computer. Although I didn’t translate those content for other platforms, I think creating content online (or even running a company) would also benefit from thinking about theatrical performances. Perhaps this is why Ted Nelson said computers are a branch of filmmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking also aligns with how Disney structure their organization. They call all of their customers, regardless of which service/product they are referring to, their guests. If they are guests, they are here for an experience, and you as hosts should do your best in making sure they feel comfortable and have a good time. They also call their employees crew member, instead of staff. As a crew member, you are part of a larger team that’s putting on a show, you represent the larger identity that the team has crafted. So when you wear your uniform, you represent all of your fellow crew members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I love this metaphor, something that I still don’t understand though, is how and if this metaphor is euqally effective when addressing larger and more complex challenges like climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching America and Britain’s got talent this past two weeks. I remember seeing snippets of them in highschool but I didn’t pay much attention to them. Lately, as I’ve been thinking about more about movements and ways to inspire others, I find the auditions on these shows being particularly relevant. The energy that the comedians, singers, dancers, magicians, and others brought to the show are infectious (in a really good way).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been thinking about the idea of performing.

In retrospect that’s not really possible, because half baked thoughts are just really loose. However, what I’ve noticed is that, by writing more frequently, I’m able to think more clearly in terms of when I started thinking about a new thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about how to come up with new terms. New phrases are often needed to describe a new combination of activity or thinking, but it’s hard to understand what will stick. Metaphors or mashing two words together often work well. Some friends and I tried to brainstorm around something that we are working on, and it’s really hard to come up with a new name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started growing mushrooms about 10 days ago. And it’s going pretty well given that it’s my first time? I wish there wasn’t the heat wave in bay area cause the mushrooms starting looking weird because of the heat wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milk tea with brown sugar has been pretty popular in China lately. I never tried it when I was there earlier in the year. I bought one a few weeks for the first time and they are surprinsgly good given how ordinary the ingredients are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a hike with college roommates last week and it was really fun! We got to fly the drone a little more and just spend time in a signal-free environment. Sometimes it’s hard to remind myself how fun it can be to hideaway from cities for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hiking.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;hiking with friends&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got to play with some moment lens and it’s really fun to see tiny details in the world. I’ve been comparing different cameras lately and looking at the type of cameras different type of people use. It’s fascinating to see the wide range of cameras out there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">When I first set up this website for writing weeknotes, I thought I could jot down notes while linking different thoughts with different hashtags.

I feel that I’ve learned a ton about interviewing, what it means to cultivate a community, how can long-term work relate to the real world, the importance to address organizational challenges, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation with someone and we talked about the differences between a lab and a group that invents a new medium (writing, book, printing press, personal computer, essentially a new way to communicate without being bounded by time and space (?)). I thought that that’s a fascinating distinction. Historically speaking, a technology lab is a place where people gather to investigate a computing-related questions. What they do with the results of that investigation is sometimes less important (most of the time a different stakeholder go do something with that). In the case where Dynamicland claims to be inventing a new medium, it needs to be operating in a way that’s different from how a lab operates. By claiming to be inventing a new medium, you are also suggesting that what you invent will be threaded into our daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

Partially because I sometimes don’t know what to write about. So I’m trying a different approach: Everytime I’m writing weeknotes, I’m going to open the photos apps and select photos of activies that I want to share. I wonder if this will get me back on track with writing weekly weeknotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was the last week of school at CCA. I can’t believe it’s already been a year since I’ve graduated. In the past year, I’ve learned a lot and went through many different things that I didn’t expect to. More on that in a blog post later…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been enjoying riding the new BART trains. I wish there’s a timetable where I can see where all the new BART trains are, I’m pretty sure I will make sure I only ride the new ones.. They are so much quieter and brighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bart.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;new BART trains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconfigured the plant shelve at home and started planted the end parts of chives and other vegetables to grow some food at home. It’s suprising how calming I become when I can see plants in my peripheral vision while working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also loving the flexiblility and accessibility of cardboard, wood square dowel, and milk crates. I think I will try and make most of my home furniture and storage spaces with those materials in the future.. I don’t think this will work for those who have small kids at home, or those who are living in the same place for 10+ years. In my case, I’ve been moving every 1-3 years. Whenver I move, I can recycle/re-sell these materials for others to use in different ways. I can also create laser cut, cnc, and 3d printing designs and re-use them everytime I move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended my college roommate’s film screening and her film was so great! Funny that we all presented our thesis in the same room, but one year apart. I’ve been thinking about how Ted Nelson said “Computer graphics is really a branch of movie-making.” I really like film as a medium for communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ccascreening.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;film screening&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also kind of unfortuante that the longer I’ve been out of school, the less faces I recognize everytime I go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to Exploratorium on Thursday for a talk by Scott McCloud and a talk on personalizing Climate Change. It was really nice to hear those talks in person. I really enjoyed both of those talks (in different ways).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion I had with a friend afterwards was around presentation effort. We both don’t feel like people (generally speaking) put enough effort into preparing a presentation. Really, a presentation is a performance, but most people put together with the mindset “I’m told I need to summarize something I’ve been working on.” If more people treat presentation giving as movie making, I think we will have a ton more great and enjoyable presentations in the world..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went to SFMoMA with two friends over the weekend. Their new exhibitions on Snap &amp;amp; Share  (the evolution of sharing photographs) as well as Sea Ranch were both really enjoyable. Everytime I’m there, I can sense the shifts in art museums. There are definitely certain types of exhibitions that are getting more and more popular (because they resonate with our current lives) and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s nice to just relax and read books and play games 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently wrapped up a housing releated project with a few friends. Feels nice to have delivered something different. The exhibition we installed looks like a render because we painted everything in the same color. In retrospect, it doesn’t feel like the presentation was as important, because the event was much more focused on which teams are winning the award this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/house9.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;housing project's installation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A realization I had recently: I should be working on things that I can personally have the most (positive) impact on, given my set of experiences and skills. There are many topic areas that I’m personally interested in, but if I don’t have any leverage over it, or if I don’t know what I can do tomorrow, it’s worth it to park the idea for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While commuting, I listened to a podcast where Tim Ferris interviewed Eric Schmidt. Part of the interview was spent discussing about a new book called “A Trillion Dollar Coach”. I’ve never really thought about the differences between a coach and a mentor in a business context. I really like the idea that as an organization, the goal is to succeed as a team, not to have one person who performs well independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started reading about the differences between doing a listening session vs an interview. Feels like there’re significant differences between the two, though they may sound similar to most people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Weiwei Hsu</name></author><summary type="html">Haven’t had a relatively calming weekend in a few months.

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started thinking about making small custom fixtures that make home more interesting; including a cluster of pc fans that serve as an air conditioner to cool the space down. Over the next few weeks, I will be prototyping a light bulb holder (a.k.a a lamp) that’s made out of cardboard. I think it will be very cool to make a repository of furniture/objects that make a living or working environment more usable and playful.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pcfan.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;pc fan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attended an event hosted by CCA Architecture Division two weeks ago on co-living. I really appreciated how candid the conversations there were. My main takeaway is: co-living isn’t real unless people who share the living spaces are also those who have ownership in the real estate.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/coliving.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;a presentation on coliving&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Christmas gift I got two years ago and I finally opened it to ‘grow’ the cactus. It might sound strange to others that I’m only opening a gift two years later, but I have quite a few toys/diy kits that have remained un-opened and I have the tendency to open those only when my mind is fully present for it.

&lt;p&gt;I’m very much looking forward to the next few weeks: finally settling down in environments where I can be productive, and working with people who are also interested in working in-person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being in Shanghai during the end of 2018, I’ve been wanting to conduct interviews with people in China and sharing those transcripts in English. I believe that by doing so, more people will be able to understand the business culture and lifestyle in China, and perhaps form different opinions about China. I was able to conduct my first interview with someone who runs a business in China (and I’m very grateful for her time and willingness to be experimental).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a recording, I’ve been using different transcirption and translation products/services to help speed up the process. Having spent most of my time interfacing with english products/services over the past few years, I’m really enjoying interfacing with chinese products/services. Often times, I would notice small differences between products that serve the same purpose, but operates in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on publishing an interview each month, let’s see how this will go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a rocking kneel chair and an adjustable table. It’s a really nice change from constantly sitting at a fixed desk, or standing at a fixed desk.
