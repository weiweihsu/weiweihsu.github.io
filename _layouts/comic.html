  One of my dreams is to be able to express through illustrated comics, but I think it’s going to take a while for me to be fluent enough with illustrating to tell stories in that beautiful medium.

  <br><br>
  For now, I’d like to try and make collages with photos, words, and lines and shapes! As I understand myself more, I realize that I think better in a blend of media types, and I’m looking forward to making more and iterating on photo comic as a medium.

  <br><br>Hopefully, there will be a day when they become more dynamic, partially animated, bi-directionally linked, and more. If you have suggestions and/or want to riff on this, let me know!
