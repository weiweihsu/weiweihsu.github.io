  I' often re-remember the times when I wrote something everyday or every month. In order to reflect upon my work and life and inspired by Matt Webb's <a href="https://medium.com/job-garden/a-pre-history-of-weeknotes-plus-why-i-write-them-and-perhaps-why-you-should-too-week-16-31a4a5cbf7b0">article on Weeknotes</a>, I've decided scribble down thoughts and group them by weeks.'
